# blackarch-installer
Scrip to add blackarch repos to Arch Linux with fixed keyserver issues (only way it ever worked for me)

I only modified the keyserver check in the script to include gpg --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 , all other options
always timed out for me. 

For any info check the official page:
